            The first line is the one that makes the request. So, fetch(URL) makes a GET request to the URL specified. The method returns a Promise.
    
            After a Promise is returned, if the request was successful, the then method is executed, which takes the response and converts it to JSON format.
    
            The then method also returns a Promise, which is handled by the next then method.
